First task was given on 6 May 2021 but before that I was doing small tasks such as making solar car/ boat. My supervisor brought us to the engineer team to come up with ideas for their project. The propose few of their ideas that they wanted to work, and I was interested on their Bernoulli’s projects. Since we have learned aircraft general maintenance, I have the knowledge of how Bernoulli’s theorem works. We needed to recall how it works, so they asked us to research how Bernoulli’s and coranda effect works.
 
Bernoulli's theorem
The inverse relationship between the pressure and velocity of air particles or fluids is called Bernoulli’s principal. It was named after Daniel Bernoulli.

Here is a simple example of Bernoulli's theorem. The air particles moving no top of the air foil has high velocity and low pressure due to the tear drop shape but the air particles which flow below the air foil has low velocity and high pressure which cause the wings to lift. Thus, aircraft wings provide lift and engines the provides thrust to move forward. If we come up with a model to display the Bernoulli’s theorem it helps visitors to visualize how Bernoulli’s theorem works.
