First task was given on 6 May 2021 but before that I was doing small tasks such as making solar car/ boat. My supervisor brought us to the engineer team to come up with ideas for their project. The propose few of their ideas that they wanted to work, and I was interested on their Bernoulli’s projects. Since we have learned aircraft general maintenance, I have the knowledge of how Bernoulli’s theorem works. We needed to recall how it works, so they asked us to research how Bernoulli’s and coranda effect works.
 
Bernoulli's theorem
The inverse relationship between the pressure and velocity of air particles or fluids is called Bernoulli’s principal. It was named after Daniel Bernoulli.

Here is a simple example of Bernoulli's theorem. The air particles moving no top of the air foil has high velocity and low pressure due to the tear drop shape but the air particles which flow below the air foil has low velocity and high pressure which cause the wings to lift. Thus, aircraft wings provide lift and engines the provides thrust to move forward. If we come up with a model to display the Bernoulli’s theorem it helps visitors to visualize how Bernoulli’s theorem works. 

After the meeting on Tuesday, we have to come up with idea how to illustrate Bernoulli’s theorem. I thought of displaying a miniature aircraft in wind tunnel to display how aircraft wings lift as there is laminal air flow inside the tunnel. We can add white smoke to visualise how airflows around the wings. Since my team leader(supervisor) doesn’t want to display the air foil, I proposed the idea of using the tunnel which has convergent and divergent to showcase Bernoulli’s theorem. Sum of potential energy, kinetic energy and mechanical energy along steam line is constant are required in this project. The children like to be handy so to make this interactive, I came up with idea of putting foam ball into the tunnel to visualize how air particles moves inside the wind tunnel. We also can insert a florescent foam ball which will glow under the UV light to track the moment of it. This helps the visitors to visualize how pressure and velocity affects the moment of air particles in wind tunnel. Before that I have researched how ancient times implement these ideas into their life

Since there wasn’t electracy in the ancient time, indoor places will be hotter compared to the temperature outside due to the air moment inside the room. Thus, architect came with this idea of having an opening on top of the tower to let the wind flow inwards as it reaches the converging part, the air flow will accelerate and flow through a mesh of charcoal which was cooled by the water droplets from the pot.
They have placed a clap pot on top because it makes the water to cool due evaporation process. 
Then it gushes out to the room to cool down the room temperature. 

Since we have the technology and electricity, we don’t have to spend building tall towers and People does not want build because heavy houses aren’t cheap.

Working on Bernoulli’s project was something to refresh my mind. We brainstormed a few ideas like having a wind tunnel experiment, a wind blower experiment and two can with blower experiments. I have tried to do a simple one at home using the two soda cans and a hairdryer. First, I took two identical can and punctured holes at the bottom of each can using a pin and attached a string and tied a knot. I placed them 6 inches apart. When I turn on the hairdryer and point it in the middle, it moves together.

According to Bernoulli's theorem, the principle of physics says that pressure drops when there is high velocity of air. Thus, when I pointed the hair drier at the middle, that region has low pressure and static pressure at the side pushes it together. Air has velocity pressure when it moves. According to Bernoulli's principle, when a fluid is moving, its pressure is lower than when it is stationary. The pressure on the edges of the air lessens when it is no longer stationary.

We can do another experiment by placing a ping-pong ball on top of a balanced hair drier with the air vent pointing straight up. Set the hair dryer to a low or no heat setting. If the dryer is switched on, the ball will rise into the air and levitate there. The air column is not visible, but it exists. This experiment demonstrates the unseen pressure that air exerts. You can try to push the ball gently and it will oscillate back and front due to the pressure. 

We chose to use the wind tunnel as our finalized project after working on my Bernoulli project. When I told my colleague Mr. Shahrudin about it, he said it would make a lot of noise. As a result, I returned home and discussed ways to reduce the noise, which is how I came up with the idea of using sound to prevent noise to demonstrate levitation.
